ExoSim - Java Exoplanet Simulator
=================================
This is an independent science fair project by Mitchell Hynes and Joshua Murphy for the Canada Wide Science Fair 2016.
Building the project is pretty standard, just 'gradle build' and you're good to go running the Main.java in ecumene.exo.
