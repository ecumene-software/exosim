I'm not sure how you got here, but here you are!
The "good stuff" is in source/java.
Yes, there's a symbolic link in the repository that leads to a directory on my local machine, sue me.
Any java dumps (hs_***) are there as an ironic joke. Don't open or touch them >:( (I'm watching you!)
Finally, build the project with gradle build. I switched to gradle recently and if something goes wrong,
your best bet is as good as mine.
